@A@<The Diamond Programming Language@>

The language is implemented by parts that build on each other:

The @{common@} package is used by all other packages and contains
central declarations and definitions.

The @{srcbuf@} package contains the source buffer that provides characters
to the lexer/scanner. It is able to count lines and provides markers into
the buffer and pieces of the source buffer (using markers).

The @{lexer@} package contains the lexer/scanner and provides tokens to the
parser.

The @{tokbuf@} package contains a buffer that can hold multiple tokens and
is able to manipulate tokens according to previous of following tokens.

The @{parser@} package contains the parser that build an abstract syntax tree
(AST) out of the tokens it gets from the token buffer.
